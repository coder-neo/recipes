Mattar Panner Recipe

Ingredients
-----------
Milk 4 cups
Green peas 400 grams
Lemon 1
Ghee 2 tablespo
Onions 2 large
Ginger 1 inch piece
Turmeric powder 1/4 teaspoon
Red chilli powder 1 teaspoon
Coriander powder 1 teaspoon
Garam masala powder 1 teaspoon
Salt to taste


Method
------
Step 1:
Boil milk twice on high heat and add juice of one lemon. The whey will separate from paneer. Drain the whey, tie up paneer in a muslin cloth and hang it up all day to allow excess water to drain away.

Step 2:
Place the muslin with the paneer under a heavy weight to ensure that all the moisture is squeezed out. This will flatten the paneer into a flat round cake when removed from the muslin. Cut the paneer into strips or cubes.

Step 3:
Heat sufficient ghee in a Wonderchef Galaxy Wok and deep-fry till light brown. Drain onto an absorbent paper. Peel, wash and chop onions and ginger finely.

Step 4:
Heat two tablespoons ghee in a Wonderchef Galaxy Frying Pan and add chopped onions and ginger. Saut√© till lightly browned. Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, coriander powder, salt and peas and cook, adding a little water, till the peas are tender and a little gravy remains.

Step 5:
Serve hot with chappatis in a elegant Wonderchef Galaxy Casseroles.
